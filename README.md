Maze solver - a learning project

Maze solver is project with the aim of increasing my understanding of algorithms and data structures, more specific BFS and DFS algoritms. In this project I've used an BFS algorithm to build the maze and then used a DFS algorithm to solve it. 

As of Jan25 the main functionality is finished. I might come back to work on some additional features. Currently I have ideas such as: making the visuals less shitty, adding user inputs to determine maze size, other solving algorithms, time tracking for solving the maze etc.
